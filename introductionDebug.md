#  Intro to Debugging with gdb
  
### Step 1:  
**Getting example codes**  
Run the following command to copy two programs to your directory:  

    cp ~zhang/public_html/cs2000/Labs/fib.cpp .
    cp ~zhang/public_html/cs2000/Labs/samplecode.cpp .
  
  
### Step 2:  
**Use gdb to help to view the execution of a program**  
Sometimes it's very difficult to debug memory related problems. For cases like this, you can use Gnu debugger **gdb** to trace the execution of your program. Essentially, running your program in the debugger allows you to view the values and addresses of the variables, contents of **stack**, and so on. So it's also a good tool for teaching purposes.  
  
Please watch the insturctor demo the usage of debugger gdb, and then carry out the following exercises:  
  
1. Compile code with -g option  
    In order to allow gdb to understand your program, the program needs to be compiled with debugging information in the exectuable (which gives a larger executable file).  
  
        g++ -g fib.cpp -o fib.out  
        g++ -g samplecode.cpp -o prog
2. Trace the execution of the given sample program  
    Run the following command to load the program using gdb:  
    
    `gdb fib.out`

    12 assert (i>=0);  
    (gdb) `cont`  
    Continuing.

3. A list of gdb commands  
    * help: to see a list of categories of commands available;
    * help breakpoints: to see all commands to set breakpoints
    * break function_name: to make program stop at the entry to a function
      * break search // pause the program whenever it calls search function
    * break filename:linenum: to set a breakpoint at the given line of the given file name
      *  break fib.cpp:32
    * **run: to execute the program in gdb's environment**. If your program takes command line arguments, you specify the arguments (except the command name)after run.
      * run MergeSort input.txt ## If your program takes two words as command line arguments
    * cont: to continue the execution of a program (after it stops at a breakpoint), until the next breakpoints or the end of a program
    * step: execute the next statement (after the program stops at a breakpoint), this allows you to trace the program's exection one stat
    * Delete breakpoints: to delete a breakpoint that is set earlier
      * delete breakpoints 2 ## delete breakpoint number 2
    * help stack: list commands related to the calling stack
      * where/backtrace: to view the current calling stack content
      * up and down: to go to the previous and next frame in the caling stack
      * frame: to go to a certain stack frame
    * help data: list commands related to examine or modify data
      * print: to print the values of a varaible or expression.
      For example, you can find out the address of variable n:
          * print &n
      * set: to assign a value to a variable
